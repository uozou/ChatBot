telegram--->chapgpt----->telegram

chat bot created using chatgpt api connected with telegram group,
reads nessage an replay question's answer using chatgpt 
in real time without repeating messages to a particular question on restart
it dont replay to stickers, images, video or audios
it can recreated using official chatgpt api


some minor glitch is still there as
* bot crashes on each each new member addition
* replay even if members are chating with others in group
